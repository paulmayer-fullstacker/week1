#Portfolio Page
For year's I've been criticising developers for inadequate planning.
Starting to code, before they have fully explored the user requirements.
Well, now I'm guilty of the. I started coding on this exercise, before I'd finished reading the requirements.
Hense, the final submission does not hit the requirements brief.
However, as an exercise in page structure and HTML, I think that it is valid. So, I have submitted as is.

I thought that the exercise only involved HTML. So, I tried to style the pages only with HTML.
Only at the end of the exercise did I realise that I could use CSS.

I wont make this mistake again.
