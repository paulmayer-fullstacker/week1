# Submission: Build Your Personal Portfolio Web Page

## Introduction:

Herewith my submission for Week-1's challenge: a personal portfolio web page. The solution features semantic HTML and CSS styling.  
The solution is made up of two web pages, the main Portfolio page and a contact page. The pages have different styling, purely to showcase different styles. 
The web pages have been designed to scale to varying sizes of viewport. However, contemporary layout models
(like Grid and Flex Box), intended for scaling to various viewports (desk-tops, lap-tops, tablets and phones), have been prohibited. Thus, the scaling transitions are somewhat clunky, and do not operate to my satisfaction. However, I appreciate that Flex Box is the easiest way to fix that.  
Nonetheless building the web page(s) was an enjoyable and educational experience.
Specific solution features are not listed within this document, as that would be a cynical copy/paste of the requirements specification. However, some justification of my solution strategy will be offered. 
The solution has been pushed to my GitHub repository and published to GitHub Pages, for public access and review.

## The Solution:

### The Portfolio Page:

The Portfolio is the main page (index.html). This page fulfills the majority of challenge requirements. As the landing page, it is designed to be most atractive and engaging. It comprises a header and navigation bar (fixed), a Biography section, a Projects section, and a Contact section. The page terminates with a footer. Within the Contact section, there is a lin to a separate contact form.

### The Contact Form:

The Contact Form was created as a separate page. In contrast to the decorative Portfolio page, this is intended to be more functional and practical. Differentiation of the two plages offers a number of advantages, for this solution:  

- Following a modular design pattern which promoting reusable components.
- The Portfolio page features a functional anchor.
- The Contact Form could be completely free standing, with its own stylesheet.
- An opportunity to showcase more styling strategies. 

### Commenting:

I appreciate that the HTML and CSS files are not adequately commented. I hope that this can be overlooked. I understand that good commenting can enhance:

- Collaboration.
- Clarity of purpose
- Self-documentation.
- Debugging and troubleshooting.
- Maintenance and evolution.

That said, adding coments, post implementation, struck me as a shallow gesture to curry extra points, without any learning value. Moving forward, I will comment more effectively.


### Stretch Goals:

A number of the stretch goal were achieve on the first iteration of coding. For example:

- Add hover effects to buttons and links.
- Create a sticky navigation bar.
- Include additional projects or sections (Contact Form) to enhance the portfolio.

These simply seemed the right way to go, from the get-go.
